The Open Wallet is an idea to have an digital wallet simple to use as our regular wallet, following the basic principles.
1) The wallet lies on your pocket / phone (ONLY) and work in the same maner as your regular wallet. 
2) Different than regular wallet is cashless, meaning: 
  a) if you loose you do not lost your money (change cards, passwords, etc.)
  b) the wallet "carry" credit card, debit card and digital wallets references. (general speakng).
4) The wallet only storage references from where your money/emoney is.
5) The idea is strong security and integration according the instrument that the Wallet is holding.
6) The Wallet will treat crypto currency and regular currency (debit card, credit card) in transparent maner to the user. 
7) The main purpose is make east transactions (payments and receive money) regardless the type of "instrument" selected.

The first step is the begining of journey does not matter when start. (paraphrasing Lao-Tzu)
