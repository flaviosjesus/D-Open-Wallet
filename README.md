# D-Open-Wallet

## Introduction

The `D-Open-Wallet` is an idea about a digital wallet that is as simple to use, following some basic principles:
1. It lives on your __smartphone__ and works in the same manner as your regular wallet. 
1. It is __cashless__. If you loose it, you don't loose your money, just re-install an re-configure it.  
1. It holds __references__ to your payment methods like credit cards, debit cards, digital wallets (e.g. Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.) and crypto wallets.  
1. It enforces __strong security__ and __native integration__ to the payment methods that it holds.
1. It treats crypto and _fiat_ currency in a __transparent__ manner to its holder. 
1. It eases __transactions__ (pay and receive) regardless the type of payment method selected.

## Problem to be solved

Hide financial transaction complexity related to crypto and _fiat_ currency, making the experience user-friendly regardles of the payment method selected as source/origin and destination/recipient. For the `D-Open-Wallet`'s users, it is just a __withdrawal__ or __deposit__.

## Strategy

Today banks already started to work on APIs for financial transactions, in the same way crypto-exchange plataforms already provide access and wallets to manage crypto currencies. 

The goal for `D-Open-Wallet` is to provide __easy access__ and be an __enabler__ for these different financial instruments and institutions, facilitating payment in a transparent way for the ones that send and receive funds. 

Different than other e-wallets, the main responsability is not to store the amounts or customer information but guarantee __secure transactions__ between the actors `Payer` and `Payee` and __not charging intermediate fees__. 

In order to accomplish this goal, it is necessary to build an app based on a framework able to guarantee secure transactions and online transfers based on tight integration against the financial institutions.

At this point it is required to understand its __technical feasibility__ to build this kind of integration to attend online transfer/payment requirements.
